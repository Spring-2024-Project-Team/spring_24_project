# spring_24_project
The UCF Knighhacks spring 2024 project

This is a study app coded in c that includes 3 functions: timer, alarm, and a to-do-list.

Enter '1' to start the timer. After the timer starts, enter 'q' to quit and find out how much time you studied.
Enter '2' to start the alarm, enter the hours, minutes, and seconds (in military time) that you want the alarm to end. 
Example: 15 30 23 
Enter '3' to access the to-do-list. Enter '1' to enter items on the to-do-list, enter '2' to print the to-do-list, enter '3' to cross off items on the to-do-list, and enter '4' to quit the to-do-list. 
Enter '4' to end the program.

This project was created by Aliza, Annabel, Jhanel, and Xavier.
